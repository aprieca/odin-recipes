    <h2>How it's made</h2>
    <p>Make room for eggs in your diet. Here's how to fry the perfect egg with bacon fat, butter, or olive.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, vegetable oil, butter, or other fat</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Gather the ingredients.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat about 2 to 3 tablespoons of fat in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Break an egg into a small bowl or ramekin.<br> When the fat is hot but not smoking, slide the egg into it.</p></li>
        <li><p>When the bottom of the egg looks opaque, tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to scoop some of the pooling fat. Spoon the hot fat over the egg white.<br> Repeat for about 2 minutes, or until the white is firm. Spoon some fat over the yolk until it is as runny or firm as you like it. </p></li>
        <li><p>Use a spatula to move the egg to a plate. Season the eggs with some kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and enjoy! </p></li>
    </ul>
