    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Onion powder</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Fresh basil (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray, set aside.<br> In a large skillet over medium heat brown the ground beef, breaking it up, until there is no pink left.<br> While it’s browning, season with the Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.<br> Drain off any excess grease. </p></li>
        <li><p>Take the skillet off the heat, add in ¼ cup of the parmesan cheese and the marinara sauce, set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir together until everything is combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a large bowl, add together the ricotta cheese, egg, 2 cups of the shredded mozzarella,<br> and the remaining parmesan cheese.</p></li>
        <li><p>Mix this together until everything is smooth and combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook lasagna noodles per the directions on the back of the box. Layout the noodles separately on a sheet tray,<br> spraying the sheets lightly with cooking spray so they don’t stick to each other while you're waiting to assemble the lasagna.</p></li>
        <li><p>To assemble the lasagna, add 1 cup of the sauce to the bottom of the dish, spread it out so it covers the bottom.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add a layer of 5 lasagna noodles on top, you may need to cut one along the shorter end to fit. </p></li>
        <li><p>Top with ⅓ of the cheese mixture, smooth it out evenly.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add another 1 cup of sauce. Repeat with the noodles and remaining steps two more times.<br> Top with the remaining 5 lasagna noodles and the rest of the sauce. </p></li>
        <li><p>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes until bubbly. Take off the foil and add the remaining 2 cups of mozzarella cheese.<br> Place back in the oven for an additional 5 minutes or until the cheese is completely melted on top. Let cool slightly for about 15 minutes on the countertop to cool slightly,<br> this will help the lasagna to set up and make it easier to slice and serve.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve with a garnish of fresh basil, optional.</p></li>
    </ol>
